void main(){

  int a = 5;
  var s = "string";
  
  print(a);
  print(s);
}

/*
variables is like a box, where you store some element. it allocates memory
as in math, we call a = 5, same logic goes for language programming like python, c++ and also dart 

keyword for creating variable is same as in javascript : var;
also to create variables with data type same goes as in c++: int a = 5;

'' and "" same as in python for dart

when we define the type of data, we can't insert data which differs from main type

for example : 
int a = 5;
a = "asdasdasd"; -> incorrect
String, bool, double, int;
